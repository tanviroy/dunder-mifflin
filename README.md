## Description
This is #4 of the Series of Spectacularly Silly (yet fun!) websites to come.
The official Dunder Mifflin site inspired by 'The Office'. 
I love The Office. I made this tribute website. Nuff said. 
Used a standard template for the site to make it look pRoFeSsIoNaL.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank [Aayush Kumar](https://www.instagram.com/aayush_ko_mar/) for creating the witty content on the site. 
I would like to credit my really cool CS Professor Debayan Gupta (again) for being the reason behind my interest in CS. 
I would also like to thank my best friend "smol gurl" for being my biggest inspiration.
